/// `DamageSpan` is the fundamental unit of delta compression in the terminal
/// rendering system. Each span identifies a continuous region of the terminal
/// buffer that has changed and shares the same text styling, allowing for
/// efficient batch updates to the terminal.
///
/// ## Memory Efficiency
///
/// By grouping consecutive cells with identical styling, damage spans
/// reduce the number of style change operations sent to the terminal,
/// which improves both performance and reduces output size.

  /// buffer that have changed. The range uses linear buffer indices, where
  /// position `row * width + column` maps to the buffer index.

/// Computes the minimal set of changes between two terminal buffers.
///
/// This function performs delta compression by comparing two `VTBuffer`
/// instances and identifying only the regions that have actually changed.
/// The result is an optimized list of damage spans that represent the
/// minimal updates needed to transform the current buffer to the updated state.
///
/// ## Delta Compression Benefits
///
/// Instead of redrawing the entire terminal screen, delta compression:
/// - Reduces terminal output by only updating changed regions
/// - Minimizes bandwidth usage for remote terminal sessions
/// - Decreases rendering latency by avoiding unnecessary updates
/// - Preserves terminal scrollback by not clearing unchanged regions
///
/// ## Parameters
/// - current: The baseline buffer state (what's currently displayed)
/// - updated: The target buffer state (what should be displayed)
///
/// ## Returns
/// An array of `DamageSpan` objects representing the minimal changes needed.
/// Returns a single full-screen span if the buffer sizes differ.
///
/// ## Usage Example
/// ```swift
/// let currentBuffer = VTBuffer(size: Size(width: 80, height: 24))
/// let updatedBuffer = currentBuffer.copy()
///
/// // Make some changes to updatedBuffer
/// updatedBuffer.setCursor(position: VTPosition(row: 5, column: 10))
/// updatedBuffer.write("Hello, World!")
///
/// let changes = damages(from: currentBuffer, to: updatedBuffer)
/// for span in changes {
///   // Only update the changed regions
///   await renderSpan(span, in: updatedBuffer)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Algorithm Behavior
///
/// The function scans through both buffers simultaneously, identifying
/// contiguous regions of change. When style boundaries are encountered
/// within a changed region, the span is automatically split to maintain
/// the invariant that each damage span has consistent styling.
///
/// ## Performance Characteristics
///
/// The algorithm runs in O(n) time where n is the buffer size, making
/// it efficient enough for real-time terminal applications running at
/// high frame rates.
