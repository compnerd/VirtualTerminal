/// A high-performance buffered output stream for terminal operations.
///
/// `VTBufferedTerminalStream` accumulates terminal output in memory before
/// writing to the underlying terminal, significantly improving performance
/// when rendering complex scenes or animations. It automatically flushes
/// when the buffer reaches capacity and provides convenient operators for
/// building terminal output.
///
/// ## Performance Benefits
///
/// Buffering reduces system call overhead by batching multiple write
/// operations into fewer, larger writes. This is especially important
/// for terminal applications that generate substantial output, such as
/// full-screen interfaces or animations.
///
/// ## Usage Pattern
///
/// The typical usage pattern is through the `withBufferedOutput` function:
///
/// ```swift
/// await withBufferedOutput(terminal: myTerminal) { stream in
///   stream <<< "Hello, "
///   stream <<< ControlSequence.setForegroundColor(.red)
///   stream <<< "World!"
///   // Automatically flushed when the closure completes
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Buffer Management
///
/// The stream automatically flushes when:
/// - The buffer reaches its capacity
/// - `flush()` is called explicitly
/// - The `withBufferedOutput` closure completes
///
/// This ensures output appears promptly while maintaining optimal performance.
public final class VTBufferedTerminalStream {
  private var buffer: [UInt8] = []
  private let terminal: any VTTerminal

  internal init(_ terminal: some VTTerminal, capacity: Int) {
    self.buffer.reserveCapacity(capacity)
    self.terminal = terminal
  }

  /// Appends string content to the output buffer.
  ///
  /// This method efficiently accumulates string data in the internal buffer.
  /// When the buffer approaches capacity, it automatically flushes to the
  /// terminal and continues buffering new content.
  ///
  /// The method handles UTF-8 encoding internally, so you can safely pass
  /// any Unicode string content including emoji and international characters.
  ///
  /// ## Performance Considerations
  /// Multiple small `append()` calls are more efficient than direct terminal
  /// writes, as the buffering amortizes the cost of system calls.
  ///
  /// ## Usage Example
  /// ```swift
  /// stream.append("Status: ")
  /// stream.append("✓ Connected")
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Automatic Flushing
  /// If appending the string would exceed buffer capacity, the current
  /// buffer is flushed synchronously before adding the new content.

    let view = string.utf8

        await terminal.write(output)
      }
      buffer.removeAll(keepingCapacity: true)
    }

    buffer.append(contentsOf: view)
  }

  /// Forces all buffered content to be written to the terminal.
  ///
  /// This method immediately sends any accumulated buffer content to the
  /// underlying terminal and clears the buffer. It's typically called
  /// automatically, but can be used when you need to ensure output
  /// appears immediately.
  ///
  /// ## When to Use
  /// - Before waiting for user input
  /// - When switching between buffered and unbuffered output
  /// - To ensure critical messages are displayed immediately
  ///
  /// ## Usage Example
  /// ```swift
  /// stream.append("Processing...")
  /// await stream.flush()  // Ensure prompt appears
  /// let input = await readUserInput()
  /// ```
  ///
  /// The method is safe to call multiple times and has no effect if the
  /// buffer is already empty.

/// Convenient operators for building terminal output streams.
///
/// These operators provide a fluent interface for constructing terminal
/// output by chaining multiple operations together. The `<<<` operator
/// is used (instead of `<<`) to avoid conflicts with bit shift operations.
extension VTBufferedTerminalStream {
  /// Appends a control sequence to the buffered output.
  ///
  /// This operator provides a clean syntax for adding terminal control
  /// sequences like color changes, cursor movements, or text formatting.
  /// The sequence is converted to its string representation and buffered.
  ///
  /// ## Usage Example
  /// ```swift
  /// stream <<< ControlSequence.clearScreen
  ///        <<< ControlSequence.moveCursor(to: Point(x: 10, y: 5))
  ///        <<< ControlSequence.setForegroundColor(.green)
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Returns
  /// The same stream instance, enabling method chaining.

  /// Appends a string to the buffered output.
  ///
  /// This operator provides a fluent interface for adding text content
  /// to the terminal output stream. It's equivalent to calling `append()`
  /// but allows for more readable chaining with other operations.
  ///
  /// ## Usage Example
  /// ```swift
  /// stream <<< "Username: "
  ///        <<< ControlSequence.setStyle(.bold)
  ///        <<< username
  ///        <<< ControlSequence.resetStyle
  /// ```

/// Creates a buffered terminal output context for efficient batch operations.
///
/// This function provides the recommended way to perform multiple terminal
/// output operations efficiently. It creates a buffered stream, executes
/// your output operations, and automatically flushes the buffer when complete.
///
/// ## Parameters
/// - terminal: The target terminal for output
/// - capacity: Buffer size in bytes (defaults to system page size for optimal performance)
/// - body: Closure that performs the output operations
///
/// ## Returns
/// The result returned by the body closure
///
/// ## Performance Benefits
///
/// Using buffered output can improve performance by 10x or more when
/// generating substantial terminal output, as it reduces system call
/// overhead from potentially hundreds of small writes to a few large ones.
///
/// ## Usage Examples
///
/// ### Simple Text Output
/// ```swift
/// await withBufferedOutput(terminal: terminal) { stream in
///   stream <<< "Hello, World!"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Complex UI Rendering
/// ```swift
/// let menuItems = ["File", "Edit", "View", "Help"]
/// await withBufferedOutput(terminal: terminal) { stream in
///   stream <<< ControlSequence.clearScreen
///
///   for (index, item) in menuItems.enumerated() {
///     stream <<< ControlSequence.moveCursor(to: Point(x: 0, y: index))
///     stream <<< ControlSequence.setForegroundColor(.blue)
///     stream <<< item
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### With Error Handling
/// ```swift
/// let result = try await withBufferedOutput(terminal: terminal) { stream in
///   stream <<< "Processing data..."
///   return try processComplexData()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Automatic Cleanup
/// The buffer is automatically flushed even if the closure throws an error,
/// ensuring partial output is not lost.
public func withBufferedOutput<Result>(terminal: any VTTerminal, capacity: Int = SystemInfo.PageSize,
                                       _ body: (inout VTBufferedTerminalStream) async throws -> Result) async rethrows -> Result {
